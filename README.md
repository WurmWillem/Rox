<H1> Rox: A Refreshingly Simple And Dutch Programming Language </H1>

<H2>Introducing Rox ðŸ¦€</H2>
This is my implementation of Lox, a programming language so simple and Dutch that even your little sister can program in it. As of right now the language (if you can even call it that) is extremely bare-bones, but it is improving rapidly. The goal of Lox is not to create a fully-functioning language for commercial use; it is simply the hobby project of a mediocre Rust programmer.

<H2>Why should you use Rox?</H2>

- ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Je bent een Nederlander in hart en nieren
-  ðŸš€ Blazingly fast and written in Rust  
- ðŸ˜ƒ Because you are a masochist
- ðŸ¥° You want to support me

<H2>Features</H2>

- Beautiful Dutch keywords ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± (wellus, nietus, ...)
- Memory safe, as it is written in 100% safe Rust
- Arithmetic with proper precedence rules
  - Operators supported are +, -, *, /, (), 
    
  ```
  3 * (2 + 3)
  output: 15
      
  
  1 + 6 / 3
  output: 3

  "Hallo " + "Wereld!"
  output: Hallo Wereld!
  ```
- Logic operators that can be chained
  - Logic operators supported are ==, >, <, >=, <= !=, !, //
  ```
  5 == 2 + 3
  output: wellus

  1 < 3
  output: wellus

  (3 + 2 * 3 == 3 * (2 + 1)) == (8 >= 4)
  output: wellus

  wellus == !nietus == !!wellus
  output: wellus
  ```

<H2>How do I use Rox?</H2>

- Download the source code and either
  - Download the source code and execute it with the command cargo run "expression" as such 
  ```
  cargo run "2 + 1"
  output: 3
  ```
  - Or create a file called "file.lox" in the same directory as the project and execute the command cargo run without additional arguments
  ```
  cargo run
  output: 3
  ```
- Ask me for a binary and I'll send you an executable for your platform
<H2>Roadmap</H2>

- Make it an actually functioning language with variables and control flow ðŸ’€
- Add enums
- Remove null and replace it with Option<T> enum
  - Most of my homies hate null
- /* */ support
- multiplication on strings
